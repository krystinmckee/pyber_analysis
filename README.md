## Summary: 
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

2. Focus marketing campaigns on generating more rides in Urban areas in order to balance demand with supply in urban areas.
3. January is a slower month in terms of revenue, so this is a good time to increase marketing efforts to ensure steady demand.
